**A Short Rant**
I used Solidworks rather than Fusion360, the assembly part of the case was really annoying, I didn't know what to do, and the tutorials online weren't great, but I got it done alright, I think.

##The Schematic / PCB:
-------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------
I wasn't too sure on how to make the PCB. It's my first time using KICad and making a PCB schematic. The routing and pcb itself looks pretty bad, it doesn't use a switch matrix, it's directly wired. I'm not too sure what that means but yeah. I tried to follow the beginner friendly tutorial as close as possible, then added the OLED display and RotaryEncoder, but kind of winged it, as there was no tutorial on how to do those ones. I don't know if this PCB will work, but I hope it will. Lastly, the OLED display area, I'll just directly solder the pins on the OLED display into the holes rather than using a JConnector.

##The Assembly:
----------------------------------

---------------------------------------------
This design follows the tutorial really pretty closely with only a few differences, but I think that's fine for a semi-beginner.

I add the PCB with wiring,soldering, and etc... Into the bottom case. 4x M3x16mm screws go through the bottom of the cas, then I use 4x M3x5mx4mm heatset inserts to secure the screws. The add the keycaps and boom done.

I don't know how well, or if any of this even works, but regardless, I think I learned a decent bit and did something cool that I've never done before.
